# Game Project üéÆ

This is a game project that allows two players to control characters and engage in a battle. The objective of the game is to defeat the opponent player by reducing their health points to zero.

## Game Description

The game features a side-scrolling environment where two players control their respective characters and engage in a battle. The characters can move horizontally, jump, and perform attacks to damage their opponent. The game provides visual feedback, including health bars for each player and an on-screen timer.

## Game Components üîß

The game project is built using the following components:

- **HTML**: The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure of the game page. It includes the game canvas and necessary elements for displaying game information.

- **CSS**: The CSS file (`styles.css`) contains styles and layout rules for the game elements, providing visual aesthetics and responsiveness to the game interface.

- **JavaScript**: The game logic and functionality are implemented using JavaScript. The main JavaScript file (`game.js`) handles player movement, collision detection, health management, game flow, and other game-related operations. The game utilizes the HTML5 canvas element to render the game graphics.

- **Sprites and Images**: The game utilizes sprite sheets and individual images for character animations, background elements, and other graphical assets. These images are stored in the `assets` directory.

- **Utility Functions**: The game includes a utility file (`util.js`) that provides helper functions for collision detection, determining the winner, and managing the game timer.
